Union and intersection types are fundamental concepts in TypeScript that allow you to compose and define more complex types from existing ones. They offer distinct advantages for modeling different data relationships:

**Union Types ( | )**

* **Represent multiple possible types:** A union type lets you specify that a variable or property can hold one of several different types. This is useful for situations where a value can have different structures depending on the context.
  * Example: `type LoginInput = string | { username: string; password: string };` - This union allows either a username string or an object with username and password properties for login.

* **Handle heterogeneous data:** When dealing with data from external sources or APIs that might have varying formats, union types provide flexibility in handling the different possibilities.
  * Example: `type ApiResponse = { data: string } | { error: string };` - This union represents an API response that can either have data (string) or an error message (string).

* **Model optional properties:** You can create optional properties by using a union that includes `undefined` or `null` along with the desired type.
  * Example: `type User = { name: string; age?: number };` - This type defines a `User` object with a required `name` property and an optional `age` property that can be `number`, `undefined`, or `null`.

**Intersection Types ( & )**

* **Combine existing types:** Intersection types allow you to create a new type that inherits the properties from all the types it intersects. This is useful for modeling objects that require characteristics from multiple existing types.
  * Example: `type Product = { name: string; price: number } & { stock: number };` - This type combines a product with a name and price with another type that has stock information. The resulting `Product` type requires all these properties.

* **Enforce stricter type requirements:** By intersecting types, you can create more specific types that restrict the allowed values. This improves type safety and helps prevent errors.
  * Example: `type ValidatedUser = User & { email: string };` - This type takes the `User` type and intersects it with a type that requires an `email` property. This ensures a valid user has both name and email.  

**Choosing Between Union and Intersection:**

* Use union types when a variable or property can have one of several distinct, unrelated types.
* Use intersection types when you want to combine the properties of multiple types to create a new, more specific type.

**Benefits of Union and Intersection Types:**

* **Improved Type Safety:** By defining type relationships, you catch potential errors at compile time, making your code more robust.
* **Enhanced Code Readability:** Clear type definitions make your code easier to understand and maintain for yourself and others.
* **Flexibility in Data Modeling:** Union and intersection types allow you to model complex data structures effectively.

In summary, union and intersection types are powerful tools in TypeScript for building flexible and type-safe applications. Understanding their proper use can significantly improve your TypeScript development experience.
