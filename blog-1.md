TypeScript's union ( | ) and intersection ( & ) types are like building blocks for data. Unions let a value be one of several types, like a variable that can hold either a string or a number. Intersections combine existing types, like creating a "product" type with properties from both "name & price" and "stock level".  

They improve your code by:

* Catching errors early: Defining type relationships prevents issues before running code.
* Making it clearer: Clear types make code easier to understand and maintain.
* Offering flexibility: You can model complex data structures effectively.

Think Legos: unions are like having multiple sets, intersections let you combine them for more intricate creations!
